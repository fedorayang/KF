This project was started to test different avaiable tools to track mutual funds and hedge fund using Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM thereafter) introduced my Sharpe and Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT thereafter) introduced by Ross. The purpose of the CAPM model is to use a set of generic investable market indices to decompose the exposure of a fund. On the other hand, APT model is to find a set of generic indices which are not necessarily investable, to decompose the behaviour of an indices that we wish to analyse.

Dependency:

This project requires
Scipy (http://www.scipy.org/)
Numpy (http://numpy.scipy.org/)
CVXOPT (http://abel.ee.ucla.edu/cvxopt/)

The primary data structure is DataFrame in timeSeriesFrame.py although this is not used directly. The container for time series data is TimeSeriesFrame which are used by Regression.

Regression is a base class for all the estimation procedures. Itself is implemented as constrained regression with all data (This should be chagned very soon). To implement other procedures, sub-class Regression and overwrite all the functions in it.

Implemented and Tested:
Regression

Implemented:
KalmanFilter
ConstrainedKalmanFilter
KalmanSmoother
ConstrainedKalmanSmoother

To Do:
Flexible Least Squares
Constrained Flexible Least Squares
Rolling locally Weighted Regression with
Rolling locally Weighted Regression with Constraints
Calibration Procedures
Testing Suite
Statistical Functions for TimeSeriesFrame and DataFrame
Data Parser from various source like Yahoo (Already written something in SQLAlchemy)
